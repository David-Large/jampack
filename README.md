## What is `jampack`?

> Not a bundler. Not a framework.

`jampack` is a post-processing tool that takes the output of your [Static Site Generator (aka SSG)](https://jamstack.org/generators/) and optimizes it for best user experience and best [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/learn-core-web-vitals/) scores.

## Why `jampack`?

- **Better user experience**. Specially on low-end devices.
- **Better SEO**. Page experience now [affects ranking](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/page-experience).
- **Easier maintenance**. Generating top performance webpages requires extra engineering in the composition of the pages that is counterproductive with the maintenance of the website.
