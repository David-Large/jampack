On January 31th 2023, 15 days ago, [Swyx updated his personal website for 2023](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1620346633778262018?s=20&t=HgXgTwdohENbYJviU64Fzw).

Following Swyx mantra: [Pick Up What They Put Down](https://www.swyx.io/puwtpd), I decided to see if I
can improve the performance of his website using `jampack` 😋

The 2022 version of the website was a rewrite in [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

This 2023 millesime is an upgrade to [SvelteKit 1.0 released in Mid-December 2022](https://svelte.dev/blog/announcing-sveltekit-1.0).

## Let's build our own copy

I'm gonna build my own copy of the Swyx's site and host it on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
This way I'm not impacted by any of what could be going on in production.

- Clone here: https://github.com/divriots/swyxdotio
- Hosted here: https://swyxdotio-original.netlify.app

### Checking performance

**Original on https://swyx.io**

```
SpeedIndex: 4.603ms
LCP: 5.108s
CLS: 0
TBT: 1.315s
76 requests
Download: 2.575MB
```

**My copy on https://swyxdotio-original.netlify.app**

```
SpeedIndex: 4.308s
LCP: 4.897s
CLS: 0
TBT: 1.263s
76 requests
Download: 2.575MB
```

Looks close enough.

**Request waterfall**

### Observations

- LCP is bad at 4.8s. Should be below 2.5s for "GOOD" score.
- CLS is at 0. Perfect.
- TBT is at a woping 1.2s - It should be below 0.2s I think 🤔
- The HMTL page is a massive 4MB uncompressed (1.3MB compressed). This looks way to big. Why?
- It take a full 3 seconds for the assets (`CSS` and `JS`) to start downloading... Why?

## Okay! Let's go optimizing!

- Optimized branch will be here: https://github.com/divriots/swyxdotio/tree/jampack
- Optimized branch will be deployed here: https://swyxdotio-jampack.netlify.app

## First surprise

There is no `.html` files on the output build 😂. `jampack` is not going to do much without HTML files 🫠.
`jampack` can minify the 60 images present in the output build but that's about it.

There is no `.html` because SvelteKit is configured to use the
[Netlify adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-netlify) to render in functions.
This is actually not a static site... 🤦‍♂️

I will not give up so easily!

## Let's turn it into a static site!

Apparently, I can swap [`@sveltejs/adapter-netlify`](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-netlify)
with [`@sveltejs/adapter-static`](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-static) and have a static site
on the output.

Not an easy task - some things are specifically dynamic routes.

After a long battle with SvelteKit, I focused by efforts on rendering just the home page.

### Performance result

```
SpeedIndex: 1.224s
LCP: 2.508s
CLS: 0
TBT: 1.123s
76 requests
Download: 2.575MB
```

<picture>
  <img
    src={jampack_waterfall_s1_static}
    alt="Request Waterfall after turning prerendering"
  />
</picture>

### Observations

- LCP is very close to 2.5s.
- CLS is at 0. Perfect.
- TBT is unchanged.

I guess this had to be expected. Without browser cache (as used here in benchmarks), the
original site had to generate the HTML page by functions. Kickstarting the function and
generating a 4MB HTML is not a blazing fast task.

The new static version of the page shows tremendous performance benefits.

## Let's run `jampack` out-of-the-box

Install `jampack v0.9.1`

```
npm i -D @divriots/jampack
```

Add to build

```js
"build": "vite build && jampack ./build",
```

### `jampack` output

```

Only one `index.html` processed and a few assets minified.

Not much to do on this page.
The avatar image of Shawn has been transformed to progressive JPEG to optimise CLS - shaving 3.3KB in the process.
The rest is _in situe_ compression and minification.

### Performance result

```
SpeedIndex: 1.321s
LCP: 2.449s
CLS: 0
TBT: 1.150s
77 requests

```

<picture>
  <img
    src={jampack_waterfall_s2_jp091}
    alt="Request Waterfall after turning prerendering"
  />
</picture>

### Observations

- Not a tremendous improvement over pure static.
- But we manage to get LCP below 2.5s :)
- Mobile phone users with low bandwidth will benefit most from the progressive JPEG.
- There are way too many `youtube.com` requests from 4 embed after the fold. We should make them load lazy.

## Let's add lazy `<iframe>` to `jampack`

## Conclusion

I'm sad I couldn't work with more pages. There are very good performance improvements
in the blog post pages. Specially with images.

Indeed, the blog uses GitHub issues as a CMS. It's very clever but images are very large
and slow. `jampack` would have done miracles here.

I will probably come back to it later when I'm capable of building more static pages
from Shawn's site.
