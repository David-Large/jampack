title: Adding config

[Jampack](/) is now using [Nate Moore](https://github.com/natemoo-re)'s
[proload](https://github.com/natemoo-re/proload) package to load a configuration file.

It supports any of the following files:

- `jampack.config.js` (in ESM or CJS format)
- `jampack.config.mjs`
- `jampack.config.cjs`
- `config/jampack.config.js` (in ESM or CJS format)
- `config/jampack.config.mjs`
- `config/jampack.config.cjs`

Or in a top-level `jampack` property in your `package.json`.

This will be great to offer some flexibility and also add new experimental features behind flags!

See the [Configuration](/configuration) page for the available options so far.
