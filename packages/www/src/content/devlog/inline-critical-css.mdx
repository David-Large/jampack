title: Inline critical CSS
---

[jampack](/) has a new option to inline critical CSS.

- Avoids a [FOUC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content) while the stylesheet is remotely downloaded after the html content.
- Improves [CLS](https://web.dev/cls/) score of [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/).

```js
{
  css: {
    inline_critical_css: true,
  }
}
```

See [Inline critical CSS](/features/inline-critical-css/) for more details.

## Limitations

Only works for relative stylesheet. I hope to improve [critters](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/critters) to also support absolute stylesheet.

## Released

- `jampack 0.20.0+`
