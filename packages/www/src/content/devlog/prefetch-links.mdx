[jampack](/) has a new option to prefetch links on pages.

This makes navigation to subsequent pages load faster.

```js
{
  misc: {
    prefetch_links: 'in-viewport' | 'off';
  }
}
```

- `off`: No prefetch of links.
- `in-viewport`: Links are prefetched when entering viewport.

See [Prefetch links](/features/prefetch-links/) for more details.

## Released

- `jampack 0.20.0+`
