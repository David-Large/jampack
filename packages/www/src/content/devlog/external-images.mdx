title: Optimizing external images
---

As of today, [jampack](/) only processes and optimizes local images available in the static source of files.

What about external images stored in a CDN or remote storage?

## Step 1: Config

Because this may not be suitable for everybody we will use our brand new config to optionaly make it available.

```js
image: {
    external: {
      process: 'off' | 'download',
    },
}
```

Later, I would like to introduce other options like:

- `add-dimensions-only`: Only add dimensions to the images when missing and no image is downloaded.
- `cdn-srcset-when-possible`: using image CDN capabilities for resize and image format for `srcset` images.

## Step 2: Download

External images will be download and stored in folder `_jampack/` at the root of the static website and
they will be processed and optimized as local images.

And with this, [we have the demo working](/features/optimize-images-external/)!

## Step 3: Caching

We don't want to download all images and reprocess them for every run of `jampack`.

If the image didn't change we should not re-download.

Let's use [HTTP Caching](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching)!

### Adding downloaded images to the cache

`jampack` already has a [cache for processed images](/cache) located in folder `.jampack`.

Let use it as well for downloaded images.

- Processed images by `sharp` will go to subfolder `img`.
- Downloaded images will go to subfolder `img-ext`.

### Let's ask if the image has changed

`jampack` will call all external images with `If-Modified-Since` HTTP header (when image is in cache).
The server should respond status `200 OK` if a new image exist or `304 Not modified` if the image is the same.
CDNs are good at that!

If the server respond with `304 Not modified` we will then source the image directly from the cache.

```
# Performance results (Processing 10 external images)
- Without cache => ~8s
- With 304 => ~2.5s
(this will obviously vary with image size and network speed)
```

**Success!**

But this means we still have to make a HTTP request for each image.
For websites with thousands of external images this could still be
a performance issue.

### If we know the image is still fresh, don't even ask

In the HTTP response, the server tells us how long we can cache the image and don't even ask for it.

This is done though headers properties [`Expires` or `Cache-Control: max-age`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching#expires_or_max-age).

`jampack` will calculate the expiration time of the image and take the image directly from the cache without any HTTP call. Exactly like a browser.

**Success!**

```
# Performance results (Processing 10 external images)
- Without cache => ~8s
- With 304 => ~2.5s
- Direct from cache => ~0.25s
```

We have now an efficient external image download üëç

External images are usually immutable when served from a CDN for example. So we can expect very high rate of cache use.
Only new external images are likely to be downloaded.

### Support for no-cache directive

Sometimes images should not be cache because they are generated on demand.

So `jampack` implements the following directives in HTTP Header:

- `Cache-Control: no-cache`
- `Cache-Control: max-age=0, must-revalidate`

As explained in [HTTP Caching "Force Revalidation"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching#force_revalidation).

### What about the same image on multiple pages?

The same image should be downloaded only once. The cache will take care of this usecase üëç

## It's not perfect

There are a little bit more subtleties in proper HTTP cache management. But this first version should be good
enough to cover the common ones.

We will improve the cache as we go and as we encounter performance issues or bugs.

## The result

`jampack` has a now an [configuration](/configuration/) to [download and process external images](/features/optimize-images-external/):

```js
image: {
    external: {
      process: 'off' | 'download',
    },
}
```

combined with a cache that tries to make it not too slow üí™
